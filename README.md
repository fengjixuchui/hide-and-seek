# hide-and-seek

PoC for hiding processes from Windows Task Manager by manipulating the graphic interface

# WORK IN PROGRESS

### Description

Window messages can be used to communicate user actions to other processes. This proof of concept manipulates windows elements from the Windows Task Manager process to hide another process. 

*The same technique can be used to hide Windows services, registry keys from Regedit or other elements*. 

The first hurdle to overcome when creating this is *__UIPI__*:

> User Interface Privilege Isolation (UIPI) is a technology introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 to combat [shatter attack exploits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shatter_attack). UIPI's Mandatory Integrity Control prevents processes with a lower integrity level from sending messages to higher integrity level processes (*except for a very specific set of UI messages*).

Because of UIPI, nowadays this technique requires running the process with elevated privileges. In a real world scenario, UAC [can be bypassed](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) and [UIPI can be disabled](https://nsylvain.blogspot.com/2008/01/integrity-drop-or-how-to-disable-uipi.html).

When creating this PoC, [WinSpy++](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=28220) was tremendously useful to figure out the hierarchy of various Windows elements of Task Manager. Kudos to James Brown (WinSpy++ developer) and other people who worked on creating and maintaining this great tool!

One other difficulty is that one process cannot easily read elements from another process's GUI elements, like list items. For this, I had to use a [workaround](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5570/Stealing-Program-s-Memory):
* First allocate memory inside the target process - Task Manager
* Send a message to the Task Manager process to read te process list elements _to that memory block_
* Read the memory of the Task Manager and get the process list elements

The PoC also does a few things to prevent the re-appearance of the hidden process:

* Pauses the refresh of the process list
* Disables the _Update speed_ menu
* Disables the _Refresh now_ menu option

### Usage

* Start *Windows Task Manager* ‚ûù Details tab.
* Launch a test process (```calc.exe```)
* Launch the PoC from a console with admin rights

* Note that after a first run the _Refresh now_ will be disabled and also the _Update speed_ will be paused. To re-test, Task Manager needs to be restarted!

### Compile

Compiled with **Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019, Version 16.5.3** as a **64-bit application** - This is very important since Task Manager is a 64-bit application and reading/writing from its memory from a 32-bit process would be a lot more difficult.

Tested on Microsoft Widows 8.1 Enterprise, Version 6.3.9600, 64-bit.
